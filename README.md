Very simple autoclicker meant to run in the command line. Prompts the user to type in the rate of clicks in miliseconds before starting and then allows the user to toggle the clicker on and off with the 'F1' key, quit the program with 'Q', or change the click-rate with 'F2'.
Designed to be easy to use, lightweight, and fast.
